= Create/Read/ Modify an Excel sheet by using Microsoft Graph API

Microsoft Graph is a RESTful web API that enables you to access Microsoft Cloud service resources. After you register your app and get authentication tokens for a user or service, you can make requests to the Microsoft Graph API.

== 1. Register your application

       1. Prerequisite
		* To access to the Microsoft Graph API you must have an Azure account : You can create one and access to Microsoft Graph for free. indeed with a free account we can create up to 10 applications on Azure and send 1 000 0000 requests per month. So for our project it is more than enough. Azure also propose paid sevices for more features like Azure SQL Database, VPN ,virtual machine etc. (https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F[source (bottom of the page to see what we have for free)]
		* If you haven't an Azure account, don't worry you can create new a one. Just make sure that you are using a personnal email (if you use your Dauphine email you will not be able to register your app as we can see on the picture below). You can learn more about that by reading this https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-finally-blocking-users-creating-microsoft-account-work-email-address/[article].

       3. Go to the Register App page with https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps[this link]  .
           After signing up or registering, you will be lead to the the Register App page.
           On the Register an App page, set the values as follows.

== 2. Add Microsoft Graph SDKs to your Maven Project
[start=1]
       1. The Microsoft Graph SDKs are designed to simplify the access of Microsoft Graph API.
       The service library of Microsoft Graph SDKs contains models and request builders that are generated from Microsoft Graph metadata. So it will allow you to interact easily with your Onedrive. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage[OneDrive] is an online storage platform offered by microsoft.

       2. Add the dependency in the dependencies element in pom.xml:
       
```xml
<dependency>
       <groupId>com.microsoft.graph</groupId>
	<artifactId>microsoft-graph-auth</artifactId>
	<version>0.3.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.microsoft.graph</groupId>
